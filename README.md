# CrewAI Examples Repository

A collection of practical examples, tutorials, and starter projects demonstrating the power and flexibility of CrewAI for building multi-agent AI systems.

## üöÄ What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI enables these agents to work in tandem, tackling complex tasks that would be difficult for a single agent to handle. 
This repository serves as a practical guide to getting started.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv** (Python package manager)
- An API key from **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, or another supported LLM provider.
- **Serper API Key** (for search functionality):
    - Get it from: [https://serper.dev/api-key](https://serper.dev/api-key)

- **Browserless API Key** (for web scraping and browser automation):
    - Get it from: [https://www.browserless.io/](https://www.browserless.io/)




## ‚ö° Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FarahBaraket-03/CrewAi_Exemples.git
    cd CrewAi_Exemples
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    `uv` makes this incredibly fast. From the project root, run:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    This will read the `pyproject.toml` file and create a virtual environment (in `.venv`) with all necessary dependencies installed.


3.  **Fill in your `.env` file:**
    ```env
    # LLM Provider (Choose one)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
    # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here

    # Search & Browser Tools
    SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-api-key-here
    BROWSERLESS_API_KEY=your-browserless-api-key-here
    ```





    ## ü§ñ How to Create Your Own Crew

The general pattern for building with CrewAI is:

1.  **Define Agents:** Create your AI workforce. Assign each agent a `role`, a `goal`, and a `backstory`.
2.  **Create Tasks:** Break down your objective into smaller tasks. Assign each task to an agent and define the expected output.
3.  **Form the Crew:** Assemble your agents into a crew. Choose a process (e.g., `sequential` or `hierarchical`) that dictates how they collaborate.
4.  **Kick it off:** Run `crew.kickoff()` and let your AI team do the work!
